# Linked-list
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers. In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
### Singly linked list
A self referential data structure. A list of elements, with a head and a tail; each element points to another of its own kind.
### Doubly linked list
 A self referential data structure. A list of elements, with a head and a tail; each element points to another of its own kind in front of it, as well as another of its own kind, which happens to be behind it in the sequence.
 ### Circular linked list
 Linked list with no head and tail - elements point to each other in a circular fashion.
